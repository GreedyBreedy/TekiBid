# TekiBid
This github repository was created for Teki Bid under the hospisis of Miguel Ibrahim
This is where code will be exchanged untill the forseable future
demo.js is the only code here that we care about it connects mongodb 
To connect to mongoDB and see what is done use mongoDB compass with the username: tekibid
and the password TalentsEverywhere9021


Ignore the rest. Today night I will upload the design 

NP: demo.js is part of the registration process, the only thing left to do is to connect the sign up page to it.
